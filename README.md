Course project brief introduction

Group No.: 134

Group Members: Tse Tsz Chun, Lam Chun Yin

Tentative name of the game: 'Try your luck'

Concept: mixing 'guessing random numbers' and 'bingo' games

The grid size of the 'bingo' board will be 3x3 or 4x4 (if the grid size includes 5x5, we are afraid the game will take too long).

A player will need to choose the grid size first (by entering '3' or '4'), and then play the game of 'guessing random numbers'. The player will have 7 chances to guess the number (random generated using the rand() function). If the player can guess the number within the 7 trials, a 'check' ('tick') will be marked at the position of the number the player has just guessed successfully. If the number is not guessed successfully, a 'cross' will be marked on the position. If the player has not yet got a 'bingo', 'guessing random number' game will repeat, but the number the player has just guessed will be opted out. Similar procedure continues until the player gets a bingo, or until positions of all numbers are marked with a 'tick' or a 'cross'. If the player gets a bingo, he/she wins. If the player still doesn't get a bingo until all positions are marked with a 'check' or a 'cross', he/she loses. After the game is over, the player can press any key to leave. 

Disclaimer: The details are subject to change. We don't know whether the procedures to realize the idea are simple or not.
